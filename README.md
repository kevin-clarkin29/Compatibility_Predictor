# Compatibility Predictor â€“ Datahouse Takeâ€‘Home

PythonÂ 3 script that reads team / applicant data from an input JSON, scores each applicant on a **0â€¯â€“â€¯1** scale, and writes a new JSON file with **oneâ€‘decimal** scores (matching the sample in the PDF). The score can become more precise by tweaking the score variable on line 95 from 1 to the desired decimal point.

```text
.
â”œâ”€â”€ compatibility.py       
â”œâ”€â”€ sample_input.json      # given data
â”œâ”€â”€ output.json            # produced by the script
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore             # excludes venv/, __pycache__, etc.

## Quick start
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
python compatibility.py sample_input.json > output.json
```

Example result:

```json
{
  "scoredApplicants": [
    { "name": "John", "score": 0.8 },
    { "name": "Jane", "score": 0.8 },
    { "name": "Joe",  "score": 0.6 }
  ]
}
```

## ðŸ§®Â How scoring works

1. **Team mean** â€“ average attribute vector  
   `vÌ„ = (1 / |T|) Ã— Î£ tâˆˆT t_attributes`

2. **Similarity** â€“ Euclidean distance `d` between an applicant vector `a` and `vÌ„`.

3. **Normalise & invert**  
   `score = 1 â€“ (d / d_max)`  
   where `d_max` is the distance if every attribute differed by 10  
   (i.e. between `[0, 0, â€¦]` and `[10, 10, â€¦]`).  
   Result is rounded to **one decimal place**.
